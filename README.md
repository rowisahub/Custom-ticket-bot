# Custom-ticket-bot
Custom ticket bot made for a contest

____________________________________


1. Set stuff up in the config first.
2. then do `npm i`
3. then `node .`
4. Start the bot before it enters the server, as it creates a config for it when it gets added to a guild
5. Make sure it has administrator

Do `[prefix]help` to get the commands

After you to the `[prefix]setup` command remember to add the admin you want to do tickets to the Ticket Admin role. They will be added to the text channel when the user asks for a ticket
